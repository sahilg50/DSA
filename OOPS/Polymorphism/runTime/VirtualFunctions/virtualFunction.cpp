TOPIC: Virtual Function

    -> A virtual function is a member function which is declared and defined within a base class and is overridden (re-defined and re-declared) by a derived class.

    -> It provides a mechanism for dynamic dispatch, meaning the function to be called is determined at runtime based on the type of the object. It is mainly used to achieve runtime polymorphism.

    -> Derived classes may or may not override the virtual function. If not overridden, the base class function is called.

    -> When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.

    -> A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.

    -> A class may have virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.

    -> Virtual functions cannot be static.

NOTE: We cannot create an object of the abstract class.
    -> An abstract class contains at least one pure virtual function(abstract method). It can include data members, non-abstract methods (virtual or non-virtual functions, but with a method body), and even a constructor.

-> Q. Why do we declare functions are virtual functions while function overriding?
    Ans: Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
